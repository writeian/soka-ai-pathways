# Soka AI Approaches Explorer

An interactive, choose-your-own-path experience exploring **four pedagogical approaches to AI in the classroom** at **Soka University of America**.

Designed for the **2025 Faculty Workshop on AI in Education**.

## Overview

This interactive narrative helps faculty explore the tensions, trade-offs, and possibilities of different AI policies through realistic classroom scenarios. Each pathway offers distinct perspectives on integrity, creativity, equity, trust, and Soka's mission to foster wisdom, courage, and compassion.

### Four Pathways

1. **🔴 Prohibitive** — Upholding integrity through AI restrictions
2. **🟨 Balanced / Literacy** — Teaching ethical and reflective AI use
3. **🟩 AI-Embracing** — Redesigning for creativity and metacognition
4. **🔵 Collaborative** — Co-learning through dialogue and experimentation

Each pathway includes:
- **17 narrative nodes** with realistic classroom dilemmas
- **47 curated academic resources** (EDUCAUSE, UNESCO, Harvard GSE, OECD, Inside Higher Ed, and more)
- **Path-switching options** to explore different pedagogical pivots
- **Meta-reflection endpoint** connecting outcomes to Soka's mission

## Features
- Single‑page app with hash routing (`/#node=...`), no backend
- Content is **data‑driven** via `nodes.json`
- Scene pages show **narrative**, **resources**, and **choices**
- Works on **GitHub Pages**; zero build steps
- Fully responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Local Preview
Just open `index.html` in your browser (or use a simple static server).

```bash
# optional
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then visit http://localhost:8080
```

2. Commit & push to `main`
3. GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds (1-2 minutes)
4. Changes appear at the live URL

## How to Use This Explorer

### For Faculty
1. **Navigate the scenarios** — Start at D1 and choose a pedagogical stance
2. **Read the narratives** — Experience realistic classroom dilemmas
3. **Explore resources** — Click through curated academic articles and reports
4. **Switch paths** — Try different approaches to see trade-offs
5. **Reflect** — End at R1 to connect outcomes to Soka's mission

### For Facilitators
- Share the link before or during workshops
- Use "Copy link to this step" to share specific scenarios
- Discuss decision points and resource implications
- Compare paths taken by different faculty groups

## URL Conventions
- **Start:** `/#node=D1`
- **Any node:** `/#node=B2A&trail=D1>B1>B2A`
- **Meta-reflection:** `/#node=R1`
- Trail parameter tracks your decision history
- "Copy link to this step" button captures current state

## Editing Content

### Quick Updates
Edit `nodes.json` directly to:
- Update narratives
- Add/modify resources
- Change decision labels
- Adjust node connections

### Adding Nodes
1. Follow naming convention: `P1`, `B2A`, `E3A`, etc.
2. Include: `id`, `path`, `pathLabel`, `title`, `narrative`, `resources`, `choices`
3. Link from existing nodes via `choices[].to`
4. Test navigation flow

## Content Structure (`nodes.json`)
```json
{
  "P1": {
    "id": "P1",
    "path": "prohibitive",
    "pathLabel": "Prohibitive",
    "title": "Setting the Boundary",
    "narrative": "…",
    "resources": [{"label":"…","url":"…","why":"…"}],
    "choices": [{"label":"…","to":"…"}]
  }
}
```

## Pedagogical Design

This explorer is designed around **value-creating education** principles:

### Core Design Choices
- **Narrative immersion** — First-person scenarios build empathy and realism
- **Branching paths** — Decisions have consequences, mirroring real classroom complexity
- **Path switching** — Faculty can pivot approaches, modeling pedagogical flexibility
- **Resource integration** — Academic citations ground choices in scholarship
- **Mission alignment** — Meta-reflection ties outcomes to Soka's values

### Learning Outcomes
Faculty who complete the explorer will:
- Understand tensions between integrity, creativity, equity, and trust
- Explore trade-offs of prohibitive, balanced, embracing, and collaborative approaches
- Encounter 47 curated resources on AI pedagogy
- Reflect on how AI choices embody institutional mission
- Practice flexible, value-driven decision-making

## Technical Details
- **No build process** — Pure HTML/JS/JSON
- **No backend** — Fully static, runs on any web server
- **No dependencies** — Only Tailwind CSS via CDN
- **Instant updates** — Edit JSON, refresh browser
- **Portable** — Download and run locally anytime
