# 🟨 Pathway: Balanced / Literacy — “Guiding Ethical and Reflective Use”

**Core theme:** Faculty treat AI as a literacy and ethical challenge, teaching students to use it responsibly and reflectively within clear boundaries.  
**Soka lens:** Education as the cultivation of wisdom and character — helping students discern *when* and *why* to use a tool, not simply *whether.*

## Scene 1 — “Designing the New Course”

**Narrative:**  
You’re drafting a syllabus for a new interdisciplinary seminar at Soka University of America.  
You know that students are already using AI for translation, brainstorming, and writing support.  
Rather than ban it, you design a short unit on **“Responsible AI Use.”**  
Students will practice writing with and without AI, comparing their processes and reflecting on what they learn.

- **Experiment with deeper redesign.** → *Switch to AI-Embracing Path (Scene 1)*

## Scene 2A — “Ethical AI Workshops”

**Narrative:**  
Week three. Students bring examples of AI output alongside their own writing.  
They identify what AI captures — and what it misses.  
Discussion turns lively: *“How do we know when AI’s help becomes substitution?”*  
You realize they’re not just learning writing — they’re learning *judgment.*

- **Formalize these insights into a class policy.** → *Scene 3A*  
- **Open the exploration further.** → *Switch to Collaborative Path (Scene 2)*

## Scene 3A — “Refining the Policy”

**Narrative:**  
Together, the class revises its “AI Use Agreement.”  
Students agree to cite AI assistance, reflect on their process, and take responsibility for final ideas.  
You notice improved confidence in weaker writers and fewer integrity concerns.  
Still, updating and clarifying the policy each semester takes time.  
Some colleagues worry: *“Won’t this gray area confuse students?”*

**Decision:**  
- **Keep refining through dialogue.** → *Scene 4 (Outcome)*  
- **Simplify and enforce boundaries.** → *Switch to Prohibitive Path (Scene 2)*

## Scene 4 — “Outcome: Ethical Clarity Through Dialogue”

**Narrative:**  
By term’s end, students submit reflective essays describing how AI shaped their thinking.  
Most express gratitude for being trusted to decide responsibly.  
A few still wish for simpler rules, but many highlight new awareness:  
> “I learned not just what AI can do — but what I can do with it.”  
You sense the course has fostered something deeper than compliance: **wisdom.**

**Reflection Prompt:**  
> In cultivating AI literacy, what kind of human capacity are you helping students develop — efficiency, or wisdom?
