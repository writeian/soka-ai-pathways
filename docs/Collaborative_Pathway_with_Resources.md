# 🔵 Pathway: Collaborative — “Learning With, Not Just About, AI”

**Core theme:** Faculty and students co-learn how to use AI responsibly through transparent, guided experimentation.  
**Soka lens:** Dialogue, trust, and reflective inquiry — the heart of value-creating education.

## Scene 1 — “Opening the Dialogue”

**Narrative:**  
You begin the semester with an open question: *“How should we, as a learning community, engage with AI?”*  
Instead of dictating rules, you invite students to share experiences — how AI has helped, hindered, or confused them.  
Together, the class drafts an “AI Reflection Charter” that commits to transparency, curiosity, and mutual respect.

- **Formalize clearer limits.** → *Switch to Balanced Path (Scene 2)*

## Scene 2A — “Shared Experimentation”

**Narrative:**  
Each week, students log one AI interaction — a prompt, a response, and their reflection on it.  
In class, small groups analyze *where the tool enhanced or hindered their thinking.*  
Surprisingly, students begin to critique AI’s biases and limits more deeply than expected.  
You realize you’re modeling what Soka calls “humanistic inquiry” — the search for wisdom through dialogue with others and technology alike.

- **Standardize procedures for consistency.** → *Switch to Balanced Path (Scene 3)*

## Scene 3A — “Faculty Learning Cluster”

**Narrative:**  
Colleagues hear about your approach and invite you to a faculty learning cluster on AI pedagogy.  
You share anonymized student reflections — both breakthroughs and confusions.  
Another professor worries about workload: *“How do we grade process fairly?”*  
You agree — collaboration requires new assessment norms. The group plans a small cross-course study.

- **Move toward formal institutional policy.** → *Switch to Balanced Path (Scene 4)*

## Scene 4 — “Outcome: Dialogue Becomes the Curriculum”

**Narrative:**  
By semester’s end, your class talks about AI as easily as about literature or ethics.  
Students report feeling *trusted* — and more responsible as a result.  
Faculty peers adapt your reflective logging model.  
Still, you know not every course or instructor has the time for this level of mentoring.  
The project closes with a sense of optimism — not that you’ve solved AI in education, but that you’ve learned to face it *together.*

**Reflection Prompt:**  
> What does it mean for dialogue — not technology — to become the foundation of your classroom?
