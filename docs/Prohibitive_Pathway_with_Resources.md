# 🔴 Pathway: Prohibitive — “Integrity through Restriction”

**Core theme:** Upholding academic integrity by limiting or banning AI use.  
**Soka lens:** A sincere desire to protect independent thought and moral responsibility — but tension arises around trust, inclusion, and the purpose of dialogue in humanistic education.

## Scene 1 — “Setting the Boundary”

**Narrative:**  
You draft your new course policy: *“AI-generated text is not permitted on any assignments.”*  
You tell students that true learning requires struggle — *“The effort to express one’s own ideas builds understanding.”*  
Students nod, though one asks privately if translation tools count.

## Scene 2A — “The Translation Question”

**Narrative:**  
A multilingual student confides: *“I only use AI to translate readings so I can understand class discussion.”*  
You reaffirm your rule: each student should rely on their own effort to develop language skills.  
Participation drops, and you sense growing distance.

**Decision:**

- **Reconsider inclusion** → *Switch to Balanced Path (Scene 2)*

## Scene 3A — “The Enforcement Semester”

**Narrative:**  
You implement AI detection software and restate strict consequences.  
Midterm, a false flag occurs — a student accused of AI use insists on innocence.  
The process consumes hours of investigation.  
Students stop visiting office hours; compliance rises, curiosity drops.

- **Revisit purpose** → *Switch to Collaborative Path (Scene 1)*

## Scene 4 — “Outcome: Integrity Preserved, Dialogue Lost?”

**Narrative:**  
Your records show near-perfect compliance.  
But course evaluations describe your class as “serious, but tense.”  
You reflect: integrity was upheld — yet engagement and empathy weakened.  
Has control achieved the learning it sought to protect?

**Embedded Resources:**  
- **Harvard Graduate School of Education (2024)** – *“Teaching for Trust in the Age of AI”*

- **Soka University Mission Statement**  
  → https://www.soka.edu/about/mission  
  *Frames learning as the cultivation of wisdom, courage, and compassion through dialogue.*

**Reflection Prompt:**  
> How does your definition of *authentic learning* align with Soka’s mission to foster global citizens who live contributive lives?
