# 🟩 Pathway: AI-Embracing — “Designing for Creativity and Reflection”

**Core theme:** Faculty redesign assignments so that students can use AI transparently as a creative and reflective tool.  
**Soka lens:** Value creation through innovation — nurturing wisdom and agency by engaging technology critically, not fearfully.

## Scene 1 — “Rethinking the Assignment”

**Narrative:**  
You sit at your desk drafting the syllabus for your new interdisciplinary course.  
You know students already use AI for brainstorming and translation.  
Instead of policing that reality, you wonder: *What if I invited AI use as part of the process itself?*  
You rewrite a major paper assignment into an “AI-Reflection Portfolio,” where students must document prompts, evaluate AI output, and annotate what they learned about thinking itself.

- **Scale back; keep AI optional.** → *Switch to Balanced Path (Scene 2)*

## Scene 2A — “First Iteration”

**Narrative:**  
Students experiment with AI during early drafts.  
Some produce nuanced reflections; others hand in work too dependent on the tool.  
In discussion, you model *critical use*: showing how to question AI’s assumptions.  
The room fills with energy — half excitement, half uncertainty.  
One student says, *“I’ve never thought so much about how I write.”*

- **Invite faculty feedback** to refine structure. → *Switch to Collaborative Path (Scene 3)*

## Scene 3A — “The Assessment Challenge”

**Narrative:**  
Grading portfolios takes longer than expected.  
You realize authentic work requires new evaluation criteria — *growth*, *insight*, and *self-reflection* now matter more than grammar or format.  
A peer asks, *“Isn’t this subjective?”*  
You reply, *“Maybe — but so is learning.”*  
By mid-semester, students begin referencing AI critically in discussions about ethics, bias, and creativity.

**Decision:**  
- **Share outcomes in a faculty forum.** → *Scene 4 (Outcome)*  
- **Simplify the design** for scalability. → *Switch to Balanced Path (Scene 3)*

## Scene 4 — “Outcome: Innovation and Depth”

**Narrative:**  
At semester’s end, students present reflective projects titled *“What I Learned From My AI Mistakes.”*  
Their work is messy, honest, and profound.  
Some still rely too much on the tool, but most articulate a clearer sense of authorship.  
You feel both exhausted and inspired.  
When you present at a CTLE roundtable, a colleague says, *“This feels like the future of Soka education — humanistic, creative, responsible.”*

**Reflection Prompt:**  
> How does redesigning around AI reveal what truly counts as *human* learning?
