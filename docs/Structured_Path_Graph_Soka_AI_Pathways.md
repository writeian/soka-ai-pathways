# 🧭 Structured Path Graph: Soka University AI in the Classroom Pathways

This file maps the full branching structure of the **AI Approaches Explorer** designed for Soka University of America faculty.  
It reflects the updated and resource-embedded narrative flows for all four approaches: **Prohibitive, Balanced / Literacy, AI‑Embracing, and Collaborative.**  
Each node corresponds to one narrative “scene” from the markdown files.

## 🌏 Shared Start Node

**D1 — Designing a New Course in the AI Era**  
> A Soka University faculty member prepares to design a new course. Students are already using AI for brainstorming, translation, and writing. The faculty member must decide how to align classroom practice with Soka’s mission of fostering wisdom, courage, compassion, and global citizenship.

**Initial Branch Options:**  
- **Prohibitive Path (P1)** — “Ban AI outright.”  
- **Balanced / Literacy Path (B1)** — “Teach ethical use.”  
- **AI‑Embracing Path (E1)** — “Redesign learning for creative AI use.”  
- **Collaborative Path (C1)** — “Co‑learn with students through dialogue.”

## 🔴 Prohibitive Path — “Integrity Through Restriction”

| Node | Scene | Description | Next Options |
|-------|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **P1** | Setting the Boundary | Establishes AI ban; defines integrity as independent work. | → P2A or switch → B1 |
| **P2A** | The Translation Question | Confronts fairness and linguistic equity. | → P3A or switch → B2 |
| **P3A** | The Enforcement Semester | Detection and compliance dominate, trust declines. | → P4 or switch → C1 |
| **P4** | Outcome: Integrity Preserved, Dialogue Lost | Integrity upheld but connection weakened. | → R1 (Meta‑Reflection) |

## 🟨 Balanced / Literacy Path — “Guiding Ethical and Reflective Use”

| Node | Scene | Description | Next Options |
|-------|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **B1** | Designing the New Course | Builds an AI literacy unit focused on responsibility. | → B2A or switch → E1 |
| **B2A** | Ethical AI Workshops | Students analyze AI output and bias. | → B3A or switch → C2 |

## 🌸 Shared End Node — Meta‑Reflection

**R1 — “Teaching for Value Creation in the AI Era”**  
> Faculty compare outcomes across all paths. Each reveals distinct risks and rewards:  
> - Prohibitive: Integrity but limited inclusion.  
> - Balanced: Ethical clarity but sustained effort.  
> - AI‑Embracing: Creativity but heavy redesign.  
> - Collaborative: Dialogue but time‑intensive practice.  

All roads converge toward Soka’s mission: to educate global citizens who live contributive lives through wisdom, courage, and compassion.  
The goal is not to find the *correct* stance, but to engage AI as a mirror for our deepest educational values.

## 🔁 Flow Summary

| Phase | Description | Faculty Question | Pedagogical Lens |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **1. Dilemma** | Designing for AI‑era learning | “How do I uphold integrity and learning?” | Humanistic intention |
| **2. Exploration** | Following a path and meeting tensions | “What values guide my classroom?” | Dialogue and reflection |
| **3. Pivot** | Switching between approaches | “What do I risk or gain by shifting stance?” | Wisdom through flexibility |
| **4. Outcome** | Seeing trade‑offs clearly | “What have I learned about my teaching values?” | Self‑reflection & value creation |
| **5. Meta‑Reflection** | Comparing across paths | “How does my stance embody Soka’s mission?” | Global citizenship & compassion |
