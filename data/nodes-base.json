Additionally, you suspect some students use it for writing and have been able to avoid AI detection tools by using \"humanizers\" and other methods designed to evade detection.\n\nAs you outline the syllabus, you consider how each possible stance on AI could cultivate {{institution_short}}'s values, including leadership in {{value1}}, {{value2}}, and {{value3}}. As you always ask when designing a course: How can you instill the excitement of your advanced topic and encourage students to use its knowledge to live virtuous and {{value4}}? You consider five positions: 1) ignoring the issue and deferring decisions; 2) prohibiting AI outright; 3) allowing limited, ethical AI use; 4) permitting AI to support much of the work; and 5) designing the course to collaborate with students using AI tools. Each, you realize, involves risks and rewards. What will you choose?",
